# Tip Calculator

This is a simple web-based tip calculator built with HTML and JavaScript.

## How it works:

- Enter the tip percentage you want to leave.
- Click "Calculate" to see the tip amount and total bill with tip included.

## What Iâ€™m learning:
This is one of my first beginner projects as I learn web development. I'm practicing:

- Basic JavaScript functions
- Simple math operations
- DOM manipulation (changing the page with JS)
